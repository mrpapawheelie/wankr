# Test Folder

This folder is reserved for actual test files.

## Purpose

- **Foundry Tests**: Solidity contract tests (`.t.sol` files)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end application tests
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component/function tests

## Current Status

This folder is currently empty. Tests are located in:
- **Smart Contract Tests**: `contracts/test/` (Foundry tests)
- **Development Scripts**: `scripts/` (Debugging and testing scripts)

## Future Use

When adding new test types, they should be organized here:
- `test/unit/` - Unit tests
- `test/integration/` - Integration tests
- `test/e2e/` - End-to-end tests
