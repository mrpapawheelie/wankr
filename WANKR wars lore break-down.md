## Native Advantage System

Every soldier has 2 native battlegrounds where they gain a stronger advantage.

- **Native region** = home turf bonus (strongest performance)
- **Thriving regions** = secondary buffs (adapted, but not unbeatable)  
- **Neutral regions** = baseline performance (no buffs/penalties)

## Strategy in Motion

- **Building a deck** means balancing soldiers across different regions
- **Revealing NFTs** lets you see their native battlegrounds (stamped like a passport)  
- **Unrevealed NFTs?** They hold mystery — maybe the terrain advantage you're missing
- **WankrBot announces** each week's battleground, so adapting quickly becomes part of the meta
